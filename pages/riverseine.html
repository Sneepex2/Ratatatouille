                    <p>And now, let's take a leisurely stroll along the enchanting River Seine. Flowing gracefully through the heart of Paris, the Seine is more than just a river; it’s the lifeblood of the city, a historic waterway that has witnessed centuries of Parisian
                        life.</p>

                    <p>As we walk along its banks, you'll notice the picturesque bridges that span the river, each with its own unique character and story. The Pont Neuf, despite its name meaning "New Bridge," is the oldest standing bridge across the Seine, offering a perfect
                        vantage point to admire the city's timeless beauty. The elegant Pont Alexandre III, with its ornate lampposts and golden statues, is a masterpiece of Beaux-Arts architecture.</p>
